# churn_prediction_modeling

Problem statement :

In a competitive market, many a time we observe the customer-behaviour of switching from one provider to another, specially in cases where customers are dissatisfied with the service provided, or when their requirements change. In such cases, churn prediction modeling or the task of identifying customers who are likely to discontinue use of a service, renders extremely useful to the industry.


Study and analyze the attached dataset and build a customer churn predictive model to identify churners early in their customer lifetime. Draw insights from the data, perform necessary preprocessing steps to build the churn detection model and evaluate the model using appropriate evaluation metrics to measure the performance of the ML model.

Points to note :

The target variable ‘Churn’ has been included in column W in attached dataset.
Churn must be predicted for each customer.
